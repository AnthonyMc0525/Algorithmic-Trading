##Algorithmic Trading Overview
- Algorithmic Trading - Using computers to make investing decisions
- big names in the space of Algorithmic Trading
  - Renaissance Technologies
  - AQR Capital Management
  - Citadel Securities

- python is the most popular programming language for algorithmic trading
- python can be slow, so often times it is used as a "glue language" meaning it
  makes things trigger in other languages that can get things done faster.

- NumPy is popular for performing numerical computing

###Algorithmic Trading Process
1. Collect data
2. Develop a hypothesis for a strategy
3. Backtest that strategy
4. Implement that strategy in production


##API basics and course configuration
1. POST - adds data to the database exposed by the API.
2. PUT - adds and overwrites data in the database exposed by the API
3. DELETE - deletes data from the database exposed by the API
4. GET - retreive data from the databse exposed by the API

- Creating algorithmic value strategies relies on a concept called *multiples*
- Multiples are calculated by dividing a companies stock price by some measure
  of the companies worth like earnings or assets

- Examples:
  - price-to-earnings
  - price-to-book-value
  - price-to-free-cash-flow

each of these multiples have their pros and cons
one way to minimize the impact of any specific multiple is by using a composite
